Solution: because there are might be different versions of g++ complier in the system, make sure you are using the one in /usr/bin, and also check the path in bash_profile, make sure the order of those path are the exactly as you want it to be.

1.bootstrap gem vs 2.manual bootstrap install

1. is difficult to setup, required different gems work together
2. is just copy paste, and add some lines of code

1. is more powerful and convenient for advanced user, who knows where most files are for, and where everything goes.
2. is easier for beginner, few step needed, does not need to know how the files are structured, but concentrate on result.

1. is difficult to update and remove.
2. is easier to reverse

Migration/change database/backup and restore problem

when backup the database or change one database to another, the schema of the migrations is also backup-ed, then when the new database is created, there is conflict between old migration table and new one.
My solution to solve this is before restore the database, make a copy of the migration table, after restore the data, delete the migration table it restored, and run SQL query to create the new migration table.
